/**
 * Preload for the Agent Town <webview> guest page (agent-town-main).
 *
 * Its ONLY job is to give the guest a one-way push channel back to the host
 * renderer: `window.__stonicHost.notify(payload)` → `ipc-message` event on the
 * <webview> element (see src/components/modules/AgentTownHost.tsx).
 *
 * Why: the existing `window.__agentTownBridge` is request/response only — the
 * host asks, the guest answers. When an agent FINISHES a task the guest needs to
 * speak first, so the voice assistant can announce the result without being
 * asked. `ipcRenderer.sendToHost` is Electron's native guest→host channel.
 *
 * Nothing is exposed in the other direction; the guest cannot invoke IPC on the
 * main process. Agent Town running standalone in a browser simply has no
 * `__stonicHost` and degrades to the previous pull-only behaviour.
